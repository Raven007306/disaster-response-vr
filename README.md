# AI-Driven VR/AR Geospatial Analytics for Disaster Response

This project combines AI, VR/AR, and geospatial data to create an immersive platform for disaster response and management.

## Overview

The system integrates ISRO's remote sensing data with AI models and VR/AR visualization to provide emergency responders with enhanced situational awareness and decision-making capabilities.

## Features

- AI-powered disaster prediction and analysis
- Immersive VR/AR visualization of geospatial data
- Real-time analytics for disaster response
- Integration with multiple satellite imagery sources
- Specialized modules for different disaster types (floods, wildfires, earthquakes, etc.)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure data sources in `config/api_keys.json`
4. Run the setup script: `python setup.py develop`
